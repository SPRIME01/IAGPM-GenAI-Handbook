# Integrated AI Governance & Project‑Management Handbook for GenAI Transformation

## Purpose & Context

Organizations in technology, finance, life‑sciences and government contracting are rapidly adopting generative AI (GenAI) for project/program management and broader transformation. AI brings promise (efficiency, enhanced decision‑making, new services) but also risk (bias, hallucination, privacy breaches, legal/regulatory exposure). This handbook synthesizes multiple frameworks to provide a comprehensive, operational AI governance system that is:

**Actionable:** Each section answers “What do we do tomorrow?” with processes, templates and checklists.

**Multi‑framework:** It blends CPMAI+E’s phased AI project methodology, the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF), ISO/IEC 42001 AI management‑system principles, EU AI Act obligations, the Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI, White & Case’s EU AI Act Handbook guidance, PMI’s AI Governance Plan for Project Management, and insights from systems‑thinking (The Fifth Discipline).

**Industry‑ready:** It includes sector‑specific guidance (finance, life sciences and federal contracting) and emphasises continuous improvement.

## 1  Framework Ingestion & Mapping

| Framework | Core mechanism | Unique capabilities | Integration opportunities |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| **CPMAI+E**| Six iterative phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Model Development, Model Evaluation and Operationalization; cross‑cutting domains for data governance and trustworthy AI. Tasks include pattern identification, AI skill assessment, data feasibility check, data cleansing/augmentation, model selection and training, go/no‑go reviews and KPI measurement. | Provides an AI‑specific project methodology with defined artefacts and go/no‑go gates. | Serves as the backbone; other frameworks bolt on governance, ethics, regulatory compliance and learning processes. |
| **NIST AI RMF 1.0** | Describes a risk‑management lifecycle using four functions: Govern, Map, Measure and Manage. Govern establishes culture, policies, accountability and risk inventory. Map frames risk by understanding context, stakeholders, potential impacts and limitations. Measure assesses risks using metrics, scales and thresholds with policies for risk tolerance and impact likelihood. Manage involves implementing, monitoring and updating risk responses. Tables define categories and subcategories for the Govern function—e.g., ongoing risk monitoring, inventory, decommissioning, accountability structures, training, workforce diversity and safety‑first culture. | Presents a structured approach to AI risk with detailed categories and sub‑categories; emphasises contextual mapping, risk metrics, and continuous management; includes privacy, fairness and bias management. | CPMAI phases align with the RMF functions: Business Understanding ↔ Govern (policies, roles), Data & Model phases ↔ Map (context, data sources), Evaluation ↔ Measure (metrics, risk tolerance), Operationalization ↔ Manage (monitoring, corrective actions). RMF’s risk categories can augment CPMAI’s go/no‑go reviews. |
| **NIST AI RMF Playbook** | Supplementary guide to the AI RMF providing voluntary suggested actions aligned to each sub‑category of the four functions. It emphasises that the playbook is not a checklist but a set of suggestions that organizations may adopt based on industry use case. Examples include establishing policies for risk scales (impact × likelihood), defining mechanisms for impact/likelihood assessments, assigning overall risk measurement approaches, and creating documentation policies covering business justification, algorithmic methodology, alternative approaches, testing results and stakeholder plans. | Offers concrete suggestions (e.g., risk tolerance scaling, documentation templates) that help operationalize AI RMF. | Suggestions can populate CPMAI artefacts—e.g., documentation checklists for Business & Data phases, risk‑tolerance thresholds for Model Evaluation, and training/communication plans for Operationalization. |
| **ISO/IEC 42001 AI Management System** | Based on ISO’s “Plan‑Do‑Check‑Act” cycle, requiring organizations to analyse internal/external context, stakeholder needs and legal frameworks. It mandates leadership, planning, support, operation, performance evaluation, improvement and controls. It highlights data‑privacy principles—lawful processing, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity and accountability. | Provides a certifiable governance system integrated with other management standards; emphasises context analysis, leadership commitment and continuous improvement. | CPMAI’s Business Understanding phase can adopt ISO’s context/stakeholder analysis and legal identification tasks. The Plan‑Do‑Check‑Act cycle wraps the iterative CPMAI phases. |
| **EU AI Act** | Offers a pragmatic interpretation of the EU AI Act; emphasises practical compliance over theory. AI systems are classified into minimal, limited, high‑risk and prohibited categories; high‑risk systems have stringent requirements. The Act introduces obligations for general‑purpose AI (GPAI) models but notes uncertainty regarding definitions and compliance paths. Non‑compliance penalties can reach €35 million or 7% of global turnover. | Outlines the EU’s risk‑based regulatory approach with high penalties; highlights ambiguity around GPAI and need for practical guidance. | CPMAI phases should include a regulatory classification task: determine if the proposed system is high‑risk or prohibited, and if GPAI obligations apply. Align model evaluation with EU standards; incorporate transparency, incident reporting and human‑oversight requirements. |
| **Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI (Singapore)** | Presents nine governance dimensions for generative AI: accountability, data quality, trusted development & deployment, incident reporting, testing & assurance, security, content provenance, safety & alignment research, and AI for public good. Highlights generative‑AI risks like hallucination, copyright and value misalignment. | Focuses on generative AI’s unique challenges and encourages “food‑label” transparency and third‑party testing. | Map these dimensions into CPMAI: integrate content provenance and safety alignment tasks during Data Preparation, Model Development and Evaluation; incorporate incident reporting into Operationalization; apply public‑good considerations during Business Understanding. |
| **AI Governance Plan for Project Management (PMI)** | Provides a customizable governance template for AI in project management. Key components include purpose and rationale, governance principles emphasising transparency, fairness, bias mitigation and accountability, delineation of roles and responsibilities for governance committees/PMO/CoEs, readiness and maturity assessments with rating tables, a use‑cases & restrictions template outlining tasks where AI may/may not be used, tool inventory with privacy and training considerations, intake process for proposing new tools, monitoring procedures for performance and usage, risk management tables with severity/likelihood ratings, data governance guidelines referencing GDPR/HIPAA/CCPA, alignment with current policies, consequences of non‑compliance, and review/update mechanisms. | Supplies ready‑to‑use checklists and templates for AI governance in project management; emphasises roles, readiness, tool lifecycle, risk mitigation, data integrity and continuous improvement. | These templates can populate CPMAI artefacts and AI RMF documentation. They provide a practical, industry‑agnostic basis for operationalizing governance across sectors. |
| **The Fifth Discipline (Learning Organization)** | Advocates five disciplines—personal mastery, mental models, shared vision, team learning and systems thinking. Highlights that sustainable change requires understanding systems rather than linear cause‑effect. | Introduces reflective conversation, continuous learning and stakeholder alignment; emphasises intrinsic motivation and systemic awareness. | Use systems thinking to view AI governance across socio‑technical contexts; encourage shared vision and team learning throughout CPMAI phases; challenge assumptions (mental models) during data and model phases to mitigate bias. |

### Synergistic Integration Rationale

- **Generic space:** All frameworks aim to ensure trustworthy, value‑driven AI. Shared themes include risk assessment, governance policies, accountability, data quality, privacy, ethics, and continuous learning.

- **Cross‑space mapping:** CPMAI’s phases align with NIST AI RMF functions; ISO’s context analysis complements CPMAI’s Business Understanding; EU AI Act risk categories map onto CPMAI go/no‑go tasks; PMI’s governance templates map onto CPMAI artefacts. Systems‑thinking and learning disciplines support stakeholder engagement and change management.

- **Selective projection:** Preserve CPMAI’s iterative structure and deliverables while injecting RMF’s risk categories, ISO’s legal context analysis, EU AI Act classification, generative‑AI dimensions and PMI templates. Retain The Fifth Discipline’s emphasis on feedback and learning.

- **Emergent structure:** A unified AI Governance & Project‑Management System that guides teams through problem scoping, data management, model building, evaluation, deployment, risk management, compliance and continuous learning across industries.

### 2.2 Roles & Accountability

1. **AI Governance Committee (AGC)** – cross‑functional board (legal, ethics, domain experts, technical leads) responsible for overall governance, policy approval, risk‑appetite definition and alignment with ISO 42001. Maintains the AI risk inventory and oversees compliance with the EU AI Act and NIST AI RMF (GOVERN 2 & 4 categories).

2. **Project Management Office (PMO)** – ensures CPMAI phases align with organizational standards. Conducts readiness and maturity assessments using PMI templates, manages tool inventory, coordinates intake & pilot testing of new AI tools, monitors performance and tracks risk management logs.

3. **Centers of Excellence (CoE)** – provide specialized expertise (data science, MLOps, ethics, privacy). They design data‑quality checks, labeling protocols, bias audits, generative‑AI safety measures and documentation per AI RMF playbook.

4. **Domain Stakeholders** (e.g., finance, life‑sciences, government) – subject‑matter experts who define business objectives, domain‑specific regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GLBA, FAR/DFARS), and acceptable risk thresholds. They collaborate during Business Understanding and Map functions to identify context and potential harms.

5. **AI/ML Teams** – carry out data preparation, model development, evaluation and deployment tasks. They follow documented processes, monitor model performance, report incidents and support retraining. They participate in continuous learning and mental‑model reflection (The Fifth Discipline).

### 2.3 Phase‑by‑Phase Process with Templates & Checklists
