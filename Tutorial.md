# Tutorial: Implementing the Integrated AI Governance & Project‑Management System

This tutorial provides a step‑by‑step guide to applying the unified AI Governance and project‑management system described in the handbook. It walks through your first synthesis from scoping to deployment, illustrating how CPMAI phases, NIST AI RMF functions, ISO 42001 context analysis, EU AI Act requirements and PMI governance templates interlock. Use this as a quickstart to kick off new AI initiatives in technology, finance, life sciences or federal contracting.

## 1. Quickstart Overview

Before diving into detailed steps, here’s a high‑level summary of how to get your first project started:

1.  **Form the governance structure:** assemble the AI Governance Committee (AGC), PMO and Centers of Excellence. Define roles and responsibilities using the PMI roles template.
2.  **Clarify objectives & context:** define the business problem and decide whether AI is needed. Perform ISO 42001 context analysis—identify stakeholders, internal/external factors and legal requirements. Classify the AI use case under the EU AI Act (minimal, limited, high‑risk or prohibited).
3.  **Assess readiness:** complete the readiness assessment table; identify maturity level and training needs.
4.  **Map data & risks:** inventory data sources, assess quality, check privacy compliance and map context & stakeholders.
5.  **Prepare data:** clean, augment and label data; document provenance; implement privacy enhancements.
6.  **Develop & measure:** select models; train; compute performance and risk metrics; conduct generative‑AI safety tests when applicable.
7.  **Evaluate & decide:** evaluate technical, business and ethical performance; check risk tolerance and compliance; hold a Go/No‑Go review.
8.  **Operationalize & monitor:** deploy with monitoring; manage risks via the risk register; set up incident reporting and continuous improvement.

## 2. Step‑by‑Step Implementation

### 2.1 Initiate and Govern

1.  **Assemble governance roles**
  - Create AGC with representatives from legal, ethics, technical, domain and compliance units.
  - Define PMO and CoE roles; record responsibilities for oversight, risk management and continuous improvement.
  - Establish ethical principles (transparency, fairness, bias mitigation, privacy, accountability).

2.  **Define business objectives**
  - Document the problem statement, expected value and KPIs.
  - Decide whether rule‑based automation suffices or if AI is required.

3.  **Legal & context assessment**
  - Identify applicable regulations (EU AI Act categories, GDPR, HIPAA, GLBA, FAR/DFARS). For generative AI, review hallucination, copyright and provenance risks.
  - Use ISO 42001 context analysis to capture internal/external factors and stakeholder expectations.

4.  **Set risk appetite & tolerance**
  - Adopt risk scales combining impact and likelihood.
  - Define thresholds for Go/No‑Go decisions.

### 2.2 Assess Readiness & Maturity

1.  **Conduct readiness assessment**
  - Complete the 12‑question readiness table and score each item (0–3). Use the “Notes/Actions” column to capture improvement actions.
  - Example: in a finance project, data infrastructure may score 1 (needs improvement); plan to upgrade ETL pipelines and implement encryption.

2.  **Determine maturity level**
  - Define stages from 0 (no AI integration) to 3 (fully integrated). Mark your current level and identify strategies to reach the next level.

### 2.3 Map Data, Stakeholders & Risks

1.  **Inventory data sources**
  - Compile a list of datasets; document owner, license, quality issues, potential bias and stakeholders (see sample template in the handbook).
  - Confirm data provenance and licensing; ensure privacy principles (lawful processing, minimization).

2.  **Identify stakeholders**
  - Engage domain experts, potential end‑users and impacted communities to discuss use‑case context and map potential negative impacts.

3.  **Assess data risks & biases**
  - Evaluate systemic, computational and human‑cognitive biases in data. For example, a hiring dataset may under‑represent certain groups — plan oversampling and fairness audits.

### 2.4 Prepare Data

1.  **Clean & enhance data**
  - Address missing values, inconsistencies and outliers. Document cleaning steps in a data‑card.

2.  **Augment & transform**
  - Create synthetic samples or derived features when data is scarce. For generative AI, filter training data for toxic or copyrighted content.

3.  **Label & document**
  - Choose labeling strategy; apply quality checks; annotate potential biases and limitations.

4.  **Implement privacy‑enhancing techniques**
  - Apply anonymization and PETs as appropriate, and document trade‑offs between utility and privacy.

### 2.5 Develop & Measure Models

1.  **Model selection**
  - Choose algorithms suited to the problem (e.g., classification for fraud detection). For generative AI, evaluate general‑purpose vs domain‑specific models; consider EU GPAI obligations.

2.  **Experiment & train**
  - Train models iteratively, tune hyper‑parameters and log experiments using MLOps tools.

3.  **Measure risks & performance**
  - Define performance metrics (accuracy, recall, F1, ROC/AUC) and risk metrics (impact, likelihood). Set risk tolerance scales and fairness thresholds.
  - Apply NIST AI RMF playbook suggestions for risk measurement policies.

4.  **Test & assure**
  - Conduct adversarial tests, stress tests, bias audits and generative AI red‑team exercises.

### 2.6 Evaluate & Decide

1.  **Technical evaluation**
  - Compare model performance against baselines and fairness thresholds. Document results.

2.  **Business & ethical evaluation**
  - Confirm that the model meets business objectives and ethical principles. Check regulatory compliance and risk thresholds.

3. **Go/No‑Go review**
  - Present findings to the AGC. Decide to proceed, iterate or halt. Document decision rationale.

### 2.7 Operationalize & Monitor

1.  **Deploy responsibly**
  - Choose deployment environment; implement version control and rollback. For generative AI, implement content filters and watermarking.

2.  **Monitor performance and usage**
  - Track KPIs and risk metrics; use dashboards for daily/weekly monitoring.
  - Ensure adherence to usage guidelines; audit logs for misuse.

3.  **Manage risks and incidents**
  - Maintain a risk register with severity/likelihood scores and mitigation plans.
  - Define incident reporting procedures and post‑incident reviews.

4. **Retrain & improve**
  - Schedule periodic retraining and decommission obsolete models safely.
  - Capture lessons learned and feed them back into Business Understanding.

### 2.8 Continuous Improvement

1.  **Collect feedback**
  - Use structured channels (portal, shared doc) to gather user feedback.

2.  **Review & update**
  - Conduct scheduled governance reviews (quarterly/bi‑annual).
  - Incorporate lessons learned, update templates, policies and training materials.

3.  **Support team learning**
  - Facilitate workshops on personal mastery, mental models and systems thinking to foster continuous learning.

## 3. Example Project: Automating Clinical Trial Summaries

Scenario: A life‑sciences firm wants to use a generative AI model to automate summaries of clinical trial reports for regulatory submissions.

1. **Business Understanding:** Objective is to reduce manual summarization time by 50% while maintaining regulatory accuracy. The AGC classifies the use case as high‑risk due to patient safety implications under EU AI Act rules.
2. **Readiness:** Readiness assessment reveals strong data infrastructure but limited generative AI expertise. The PMO plans training sessions and hires domain experts.
3. **Data Mapping:** Data sources include anonymized clinical trial datasets, regulatory guidelines and published papers. Stakeholders include clinicians, regulators and trial participants. Bias risk: under‑representation of certain demographics; mitigation: oversampling and fairness metrics.
4. **Preparation:** Data are cleaned, anonymized and labeled for summarization; copyright permission is obtained; PETs used to protect patient identities.
5. **Development:** A large‑language model is fine‑tuned; metrics include BLEU and factual consistency scores. Safety tests check for hallucinations and alignment with regulatory guidance.
6. **Evaluation:** AGC evaluates summaries with clinicians; fairness metrics ensure no demographic bias. Risk register identifies potential misinterpretation; mitigation: mandatory human review.
7. **Operationalization:** The model is deployed in a controlled environment with audit logs. Usage guidelines require that all AI summaries be reviewed by a clinician before submission. Performance is monitored weekly. Incident reporting triggers if any hallucination is found.
8. **Continuous Improvement:** Feedback is collected; retraining occurs quarterly; governance policies are updated accordingly.
