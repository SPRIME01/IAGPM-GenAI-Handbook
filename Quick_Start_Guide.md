## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall: Analysis Paralysis
**Symptom:** Team spends all 30 days drafting policies without operationalizing  
**Solution:** Use 80/20 rule—aim for "good enough" policies; iterate based on pilot learnings

### Pitfall: Lack of Executive Engagement
**Symptom:** Sponsor delegates without staying involved; decisions stall  
**Solution:** Schedule brief weekly sponsor check-ins; escalate blockers immediately

### Pitfall: Scope Creep
**Symptom:** Team tries to solve every AI challenge in month 1  
**Solution:** Focus on minimum viable governance; maintain "parking lot" for future enhancements

### Pitfall: IT-Only Governance
**Symptom:** Business units bypass governance as "IT bureaucracy"  
**Solution:** Ensure business representation on committee; communicate business value, not just compliance

### Pitfall: Tool-First Thinking
**Symptom:** Governance blocked waiting for perfect MLOps/monitoring platform  
**Solution:** Start with spreadsheets and manual processes; automate incrementally
