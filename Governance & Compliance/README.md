## 💡 Key Frameworks

### ⚖️ Balanced Scorecard Approach

Measure Responsible AI across **four perspectives**:

1. 📈 **Financial**: ROI, cost efficiency, value delivered
2. 👥 **Customer**: Trust, satisfaction, fairness outcomes
3. 🔄 **Internal Process**: Quality, compliance, operational excellence
4. 🎓 **Learning & Growth**: Skills, innovation, continuous improvement

### 🗺️ Dual-Framework Mapping

Integrate **EU AI Act** risk classifications with **NIST AI RMF** functions:

- ✅ Simplifies compliance for multi-jurisdictional operations
- ✅ Provides audit trail across frameworks
- ✅ Enables risk-based resource allocation
- ✅ Supports regulatory reporting requirements

### 🔍 Privacy-First Risk Assessment

Combined **DPIA** (Data Protection Impact Assessment) and **TRA** (Technical Risk Assessment):

- 🔒 Data privacy and protection risks
- 🧪 Technical vulnerability assessment
- ⚖️ Legal and regulatory compliance
- 🤖 AI-specific risks (bias, fairness, explainability)
