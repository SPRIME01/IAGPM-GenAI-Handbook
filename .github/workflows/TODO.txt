Notes

The “Generate/Collect Eval Artifacts” step is a placeholder; wire in your real eval jobs.

The workflow fails on quality/fairness/safety breaches. Drift only warns (per ADR-006).

The RES endpoint is cluster-internal. If your CI runs outside cluster, expose RES via Ingress or run a job inside the cluster.
