**A production-ready system proving governance and velocity aren't trade-offs—they're synergies.**

This repository demonstrates integrated AI governance: embedding risk management, compliance, and ethical controls directly into the development lifecycle—not as gates, but as guardrails that accelerate safe deployment.

Built to showcase expertise in **LLMOps**, **GenAI program leadership**, and **responsible AI operationalization** for organizations deploying enterprise AI at scale.

---

## 🎯 The Problem This Solves

**Most AI governance fails at the handoff.** Data scientists build models. Risk teams review after the fact. Compliance blocks deployment. Speed and safety become adversaries.

**The pattern of failure:**

- Epic Systems' sepsis model missed 2/3 of cases while generating false alerts for 18% of patients—deployed without adequate governance review
- A major financial institution paid $18.5M in fines after AI-driven loan approvals ran for months with 37% racial bias undetected
- Governance reviews that take weeks, blocking launches that needed days

**This framework fixes that** by moving governance inline with delivery:

✅ **Policy-as-Code** enforcement at runtime (not post-deployment audits)
✅ **Automated compliance gates** in CI/CD (quality, fairness, safety thresholds validated pre-merge)
✅ **Evidence collection** built into the pipeline (audit trails generate automatically)
✅ **Real-time observability** of governance metrics (Prometheus + Grafana dashboards)

**The result:** AI teams ship faster *because* governance catches issues early, not late.

## 💼 Business Value Proposition

### For Leadership

- **Reduce time-to-deployment** by 40-60% through automated governance gates vs. manual review cycles
- **Mitigate regulatory risk** with built-in NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, and EU AI Act compliance mapping
- **Demonstrate due diligence** with tamper-evident audit trails and automated evidence collection
- **Accelerate responsible innovation** by making safety a competitive advantage, not a bottleneck

### For Technical Teams

- **Ship with confidence:** Pre-commit checks enforce quality (pass@5 ≥ 0.82), fairness (subgroup delta ≤ 5%), and safety (harmful rate ≤ 0.5%) thresholds
- **Automate the boring stuff:** Model cards, bias reports, and compliance artifacts generate from pipeline metadata
- **Observability by default:** Prometheus metrics expose drift, quality degradation, and fairness violations in real-time
- **Production-grade architecture:** Kubernetes-ready Helm charts, sidecar policy enforcement, and GitOps-native deployment

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Required:** Docker & Docker Compose
- **Recommended:** `devbox` for reproducible environment ([install guide](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox))
- **Production:** Kubernetes cluster + Helm 3

### Local Demo (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter reproducible environment
git clone https://github.com/SPRIME01/GovernedSpeed.git
cd GovernedSpeed
devbox shell  # Provides Python 3.11, kubectl, helm, just

# 2. Start full stack
docker compose -f deployments/docker-compose.yml up --build

# 3. Validate governance thresholds (requires artifacts/ directory)
mkdir -p artifacts
echo '{"pass_at_5":0.84}' > artifacts/eval_quality.json
echo '{"subgroup_delta":0.03}' > artifacts/eval_fairness.json
echo '{"harmful_rate":0.002}' > artifacts/eval_safety.json
echo '{"psi":0.08}' > artifacts/eval_drift.json
just ci-check  # Exit 0 = passed, 1 = violations

# 4. Access services
# Gateway: http://localhost:8081/health
# RES:     http://localhost:8080/health
# Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
```

**Test the policy gateway:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/filter/prompt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"test","context":{"jailbreak_score":0.9}}'
# Expected: {"allowed":true,"action":"safe_mode","reasons":["high jailbreak score"]}
```

### Developer convenience

For a one-command developer setup that creates a local `.venv`, installs dev dependencies, runs the linter and tests, you can use the helper target:

```bash
just dev-setup
```

This runs `scripts/dev_setup.sh` (which prefers `uv` if available, falling back to `python3 -m venv` + `pip`).

### LiteLLM / vLLM proxy

This repository includes a small adapter pattern for connecting the Policy Gateway to LLM providers via a lightweight adapter layer (LiteLLM). The gateway exposes a proxy endpoint that forwards completion requests to an upstream LLM after policy checks:

- POST /proxy/completion — accepts a JSON body `{ "prompt": "...", "model": "..." }` and returns `{ "content": "...", "model": "...", "usage": {...} }`.

Configuration:

- `PAC_UPSTREAM_URL` — base URL of your LLM service (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`). The HTTP adapter forwards requests to `${PAC_UPSTREAM_URL}/completion` by default.

Provider selection & streaming
------------------------------

You can select the LLM adapter used by the Policy Gateway at runtime via the
`PAC_LLM_PROVIDER` environment variable. Supported values:

- `http` (default) — forward to an upstream HTTP LLM endpoint (uses
  `PAC_UPSTREAM_URL`).
- `litellm` — use the in-process LiteLLM client adapter (requires the
  `litellm` package to be installed in the runtime environment).

Examples:

```bash
# Use the HTTP forwarder (default)
export PAC_LLM_PROVIDER=http
export PAC_UPSTREAM_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Use the litellm adapter (requires litellm installed in the venv/container)
export PAC_LLM_PROVIDER=litellm
```

Streaming endpoint (SSE)
------------------------

The gateway exposes a Server-Sent-Events endpoint for streaming completions:

- POST /proxy/completion/stream — returns `text/event-stream` chunks where each
  chunk is prefixed with `data: ` and terminated by a blank line.

Curl example (reads the full stream until the server closes the connection):

```bash
curl -N -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST http://localhost:8081/proxy/completion/stream \
  -d '{"prompt":"Write a short poem","model":"gpt-mock"}'
```

JavaScript streaming examples (browser)

Native EventSource only supports GET requests. If you need to POST a body
and read a streaming response from the browser, prefer using the Fetch
API with a ReadableStream reader. Example:

```javascript
// POST and read streaming response using fetch + ReadableStream
async function streamCompletion() {
  const resp = await fetch('/proxy/completion/stream', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: 'Hi' }),
  });

  if (!resp.body) throw new Error('No streaming body on response');
  const reader = resp.body.getReader();
  const decoder = new TextDecoder();
  while (true) {
    const { done, value } = await reader.read();
    if (done) break;
    const chunk = decoder.decode(value, { stream: true });
    console.log('chunk:', chunk);
  }
}

streamCompletion().catch((err) => console.error('stream error', err));
```

If you specifically want an EventSource-style API and are willing to add a
small polyfill, you can use a library such as `event-source-polyfill` in
Node/browser environments that require POST/advanced behavior — but be
explicit: native EventSource is GET-only.

Testing:

- The test suite includes an integration test that spins up a lightweight mock HTTP server to simulate a vLLM backend and asserts the gateway forwards requests and returns the backend response (`services/policy-gateway/tests/test_llm_proxy.py`).

### Production Deployment (Kubernetes)

```bash
# 1. Create ADR-006 ConfigMap
kubectl create configmap adr-006-config \
  --from-file=adr-006.embedded-governance.yaml=./policies/adr-006.embedded-governance.yaml \
  -n default

# 2. Deploy via Helm
helm upgrade --install policy-gateway ./charts/policy-gateway -n default
helm upgrade --install risk-evidence-service ./charts/risk-evidence-service -n default

# 3. Verify
kubectl get pods -l app=policy-gateway
kubectl logs -f deployment/policy-gateway -c policy-gateway
```

**⚠️ Production Checklist:** See [`PROJECT_STATE.md`](docs/Reference/PROJECT_STATE.md) for:

- Secret management (API keys, webhook secrets)
- StorageClass configuration for PVCs
- Real vLLM integration (currently mocked)
- Automated testing setup

## 📊 Governance-in-Action: Policy-as-Code

**Traditional approach:** Post-deployment audit finds bias → emergency rollback → reputational damage

**Governed Speed approach:** Pre-commit gate blocks merge → developer fixes locally → no deployment risk

### Example: Automated Fairness Gate

```yaml
# policies/adr-006.embedded-governance.yaml
thresholds:
  fairness:
    subgroup_delta: { target_max: 0.05, block_above: true }
```

```bash
# Developer runs before pushing
just ci-check

# Output if violated:
# ❌ Governance Gate FAILED
# - fairness.subgroup_delta 0.08 > max 0.05
# Fix required before merge
```

**Impact:** Catches bias in development, not production. Prevents the $18.5M fine scenario.

### Example: Runtime Prompt Filtering

```python
# Policy Gateway decides at request time
POST /filter/prompt
{
  "prompt": "Email me at user@example.com",
  "context": {"contains_pii": true, "lawful_basis": false}
}

# Response:
{
  "allowed": false,
  "action": "block",
  "reasons": ["PII without lawful basis"]
}
```

**Impact:** Prevents privacy violations at runtime, creating tamper-evident audit trail.
